# SR-CLASS-GAN

Classifying low-resolution images is one of the challenging tasks in deep learning. Usually, a low-resolution image is super-resolved to a high-resolution image and is then clas- sified to improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model SR-CLASS-GAN: a generator discriminator architecture which combines the tasks of super resolution and classification in a single model. Usu- ally, a discriminator determines whether the input image to the discriminator is real or fake. But in our SR-CLASS-GAN model, the discriminator not only determines whether the im- age is real or fake but also classifies the image. Through var- ious experiments, we have significantly reduced the number of parameters and training time while producing satisfactory results.
